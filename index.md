<span style="font-size:1.1em">
<span style="color:green">**Hey**</span>. I'm Mike. I mostly like penetration testing, computer security and cryptography. I hold a Bachelor degree in [**Mathematics**](https://math.auth.gr/en/) from University of Thessaloniki and a Master degree in [**Theoretical Informatics and Systems & Control Theory**](https://math.auth.gr/en/). 
My research interests lie in the fields of postquantum cryptography, homomorphic cryptography, cybersecurity and penetration testing. My dissartation [**The (R)LWE problem on cryptography**](http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/300429?ln=en) based on the provable hardness of the (R)LWE problem by using reductions in worst-case lattice problems and on the applications of the problem in homomorphic cryptography. \\
\\
I live in the city of Thessaloniki in Greece and currently working as cybersecurity analyst / application developer at [**Information Technologies Institute(ITI)**](https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html). I am actively involved in [**ECHO**](https://echonetwork.eu/) project which is one of the four European pilot projects for cybersecurity.\\
\\
I also enjoy learning new things ðŸ“– and hacking boxes ðŸ‘½ on CTF platforms and contests.
